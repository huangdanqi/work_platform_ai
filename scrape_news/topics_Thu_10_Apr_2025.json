    "content": "GOOGLE\nImage source: ‚Ä¶\nThe Rundown:\nGoogle\nlaunched\nAgent2Agent, a new open protocol that enables AI agents from different developers and frameworks to communicate and collaborate, with backing from 50+ tech and service giants, including Salesforce, SAP, and PayPal.\nThe details:\nA2A enables agents to discover capabilities, manage tasks cooperatively, and exchange info across platforms‚Äîeven without sharing memory or context.\nThe protocol complements Anthropic's popular MCP, focusing on higher-level agent interactions while MCP handles interactions with external tools.\nLaunch partners include enterprise players like Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Workday, along with consulting firms like Accenture, Deloitte, and McKinsey.\nThe system also supports complex workflows like hiring, where multiple agents can do candidate sourcing and background checks without humans in the loop.\nWhy it matters:\nAI agents are rapidly growing in capabilities, but unlocking their true capabilities will require a standard, streamlined way to interact with each other across platforms and frameworks. A2A could build on the success of MCP, helping build an interconnected system that allows multi-agent collaboration to tackle complex tasks.",
